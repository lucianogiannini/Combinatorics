# Combinatorics
### Class: LC 207 Mathematical Experiments in Computer Science 
Description: Mathematics and computer science have a symbiotic relationship.  On the one hand, computers provide us with tools to explore mathematics in deeper ways than ever before.  They allow empirical testing of mathematical conjectures with elusive proofs.  Computers enable us to experimentally analyze algorithms whose performance defies theoretical analysis.  Computers support visualization of mathematical concepts, that would otherwise be too computationally heavy to construct by hand.  On the other hand, mathematics provides a structure and formalism that turns the study of computers and their applications into a science and not just an engineering discipline.  This learning community focuses on the delicate balance between theory and practice in computer science, revealing the dual and sometimes contradictory nature of computer science as both an engineering and a mathematical discipline.

# Lab Objective

In this lab, you will write some programs to discover mathematical secrets behind a card trick.  The card trick is neat because it illustrates many of the fundamental concepts in combinatorics and discrete math.
